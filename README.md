# Rocksmith Volume Maxer

[Download Rocksmith Volume Maxer (Latest Version)](https://github.com/NotCoffee418/rocksmithvolumefix/releases/latest/download/rocksmithvolumefixer.exe)

## How to use
Run in the background to keep Rocksmith USB Guitar adapter input volume at max.  
The guitar volume found in Mixer should be at 0%.

## Why?
Rocksmith 2014 has a feature with it's input volume often dropping causing the guitar to not be picked up properly if a Y splitter is used.  
This tool should only be utilized by people who make use of a Y splitter (RTC/amp combo).

## How it works
It just sets the volume of any Rocksmith audio input device to 100% as long as the application is running.
